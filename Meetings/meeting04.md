About Testing:

- For the project report, test results are needed.

About Deployment:

- Should have instructions in the Readme and Writeup
- How to run it locally and host online

Notes from Cory:

- Keep in mind that the presentation is 10 min long.
- Focus on the things unique, but not things about the standard library.
- Take a video, maybe?
- Go through the register, log in, and log out.
- Show the actual app itself.
- Protection on the bet ??? (stop to request "complete match") (Keep winning money?)
- Total wins/losses (transactional?) (Be careful in presentation)
- Best Project have ever seen !!!
