# The-Old-Fashioned-Way
  
## Project Description
How do you settle a bet? The Old Fashioned Way! Our project provides a lightweight local gaming platform which allows two players to bet on and play the classic video game Pong. The application supports user registration and simultaneous login for two users, allowing for local multiplayer Pong gameplay. Users will bet on matches using in-game currency, or “coins.” Additionally, users who earn the most wins or collect the most coins can compare their status with others on the worldwide leaderboard; which can rank all users based on their total wins or their coin balance. The application also supports a customizable profile system, which allows users to add unique profile pictures to their account via url. Ultimately, The Old Fashioned Way is designed as a fun and inviting way to resolve conflicts in a classy and respectable manner.

The Old Fashioned Way was built in Docker Containers, and uses a PostgreSQL database to store its users and user data. The web application was created using the NodeJS application server which allows the database to interact with the UI. The user interface was developed using a combination of EJS and HTML.
